# Introduction

Python is a versatile and widely used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. As one of the most popular languages in the tech industry, Python is a common focus in technical interviews for various roles, including software development, data science, and automation.

In this guide, we’ll explore a variety of Python interview questions and answers, covering fundamental concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. These questions are designed to test your understanding of Python’s core features, including string manipulation, list operations, recursion, and more. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, practicing these questions will help you prepare effectively for your next Python interview, ensuring you can confidently demonstrate your skills and knowledge.

# Beginner Level

## 1. What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.

---

## 2. How is Python interpreted?


Python code is executed line by line at runtime. Python internally converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecode, which is then executed by the Python virtual machine (PVM).

---

## 3. What are Python's key features?

* Easy to learn and use
* Interpreted language
* Dynamically typed
* Extensive libraries
* Object-oriented
* Portable

---

## 4. What is PEP 8?

PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal that provides guidelines and best practices for writing Python code. It covers various aspects such as naming conventions, code layout, and indentation.

---

## 5. How do you manage memory in Python?

Python uses automatic memory management and a garbage collector to handle memory. The garbage collector recycles memory when objects are no longer in use.

---

## 6. What are Python's data types?

* Numeric types: `int`, `float`, `complex`
* Sequence types: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
* Text type: `str`
* Set types: `set`, `frozenset`
* Mapping type: `dict`
* Boolean type: `bool`
* Binary types: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`

---

## 7. What is the difference between a list and a tuple?

* List: Mutable, can be changed after creation.
* Tuple: Immutable, cannot be changed after creation.

---

## 8. How do you handle exceptions in Python?

Using the `try-except` block:

```python
try:
    # code that may raise an exception
except SomeException as e:
    # code to handle the exception

```

---

## 9. Converting an Integer into Decimals

```python
import decimal
integer = 10
print(decimal.Decimal(integer))
print(type(decimal.Decimal(integer)))

> 10
> <class 'decimal.Decimal'>

```
---

## 10. Converting a String of Integers into Decimals

```python
import decimal
string = '12345'
print(decimal.Decimal(string))
print(type(decimal.Decimal(string)))

> 12345
> <class 'decimal.Decimal'>

```

---

## 11. Reversing a String using an Extended Slicing Technique

```python
string = "Python Programming"
print(string[::-1])

> gnimmargorP nohtyP

```

---


## 12. Counting Vowels in a Given Word

```python
vowel = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
word = "programming"
count = 0
for character in word:
    if character in vowel:
        count += 1
print(count)

> 3
```


---

## 13. Counting Consonants in a Given Word

```python
vowel = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
word = "programming"
count = 0
for character in word:
    if character not in vowel:
        count += 1
print(count)

> 8
```

---


## 14. Counting the Number of Occurrences of a Character in a String

```python
word = "python"
character = "p"
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == character:
        count += 1
print(count)

> 1
```

---

## 15. Writing Fibonacci Series

```python
fib = [0,1]
# Range starts from 0 by default
for i in range(5):  
    fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2]) 

# Converting the list of integers to string
print(', '.join(str(e) for e in fib))

> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

```

---

## 16. Finding the Maximum Number in a List

```python
numberList = [15, 85, 35, 89, 125]

maxNum = numberList[0]
for num in numberList:
    if maxNum < num:
        maxNum = num
print(maxNum)

> 125

```

---

## 17. Finding the Minimum Number in a List

```python
numberList = [15, 85, 35, 89, 125, 2]

minNum = numberList[0]
for num in numberList:
    if minNum > num:
        minNum = num
print(minNum)

> 2

```

---


## 18. Finding the Middle Element in a List

```python
numList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
midElement = int((len(numList)/2)) 

print(numList[midElement])

> 3
```

---


## 19. Converting a List into a String

```python
lst = ["P", "Y", "T", "H", "O", "N"]
string = ''.join(lst)

> <class 'str'>
```

---


## 20. Adding Two List Elements Together

```python
lst1 = [1, 2, 3]

for i in range(0, len(lst1)):
    res_lst.append(lst1[i] + lst2[i]) 
print(res_lst)

## 21. Comparing Two Strings for Anagrams

```python
str1 = "Listen"
